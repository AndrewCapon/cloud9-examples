# Sensor Examples
Here are examples of how to interface common sensors and input devices.

Script            | Description
------            | -----------
accelerometer.js  | This example reads values from Sparkfunâ€™s ADXL335 3-axis accelerometer. 
joystick.js       | The Analog 2-axis Thumb Joystick allows you to easily mount a PSP/Xbox-like thumb joystick to your project.
motionSensor.js   | The PIR Motion Sensor, or Passive Infrared Sensor, is a sensor that takes a snapshot of the room and it detects changes in heat.
potentiometer.js  | A specific voltage can be sent to the AIN1 channel using a potentiometer. 
servo.js          | The Micro Servo Motor can rotate 180 degrees and is usually used in applications such as robotics, CNC machinery, or automated manufacturing.
tempPressure.js   | The BMP085 is a readily available pressure/temperature sensor using I2C. 
ultrasonic.js     | The LV-MaxSonar-EZ2 High Performance Sonar Range Finder provides very short to long-range detection and ranging, in an incredibly small package.
