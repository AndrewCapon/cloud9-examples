# Adding sensors and displays to the Grove Kit

The Gorve kit comes with a number of sensors and displays,
but what if you need to add more?  It's rather easy to add more devices if you
have the right connectors.  The Kit used a 4-pin JST connector with 2mm pitch.
[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) sells these connected to either 
[male](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3955)
for [female](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3950) leads. 
I use the male leads when connecting to a breadboard and the female with connecting
directly to a sensor or display.

This directory has examples for adding two types of temperatur sensors and
a 7-segment display.
